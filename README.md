This is the main online prescence for Dragons Delight excluding their Social Media profiles. The aim is to
provide everything that customers are looking for in one place. It is designed to be responsive so that 
users can access it from multiple devices. This site will be made with a mobile first approach due to the fact
the main income of the business comes from adventurous tourists exploring Amsterdam.

 ## Design 

  - **Colour Scheme:**
        - The colour scheme for the website will be an offshade of white (#fafafa), a dark shade of grey (#323232) and a light brown 
          (#daa520) to bring in the idenity of the business and their colour scheme within the building.
  - **Typography:**
        - There will be two fonts used on the site, both supplied by Google Fonts. Just Another Hand for the 
        headings and logo of the site, and Noto Sans JP for the rest of the site. Sans-serif will be used as the backup
        default font-family.

  - **Imagery:**
        - Imagery will be used frequently in the site to catch the users attention and entice them to sample
        some of the great products available. The main page will consist of areas with Images as backgrounds,
        and there will also be a Image Gallery Section for users to look through.

## Wireframes
       
  - You can view the [mobile wireframe here.]("./assets/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.jpg")
  - The site will have one page with 3 sections within it. There are 4 wireframes sketched for the desktop version.
    Please click the links to see each wireframe:

    and fixed navigation on desktops.

### **Languages Used:**  

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

### **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used:** 
1. [Bootstrap 4.0.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/download/)
    - Used throughout the website for responsive components and the grid system.
2. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) 
    - Used to import the 'Just Another Hand' for the site title and certain features and 'Noto Sans JP' fonts to the
      style.css page. Both fonts are used across the entire site.
3. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Used across all sections in the site to catch the users attention and fit with UX 
      conventions of being able to easily identify the meaning of content areas and links from the icons 
      displayed.
4. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for maintaining version control for possible later edits, changes, updates or fixes. 
      The Gitpod terminal was used to commit to Git, and then Git pushed to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store the project as a repository after being pushed by Git. 
6. [W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)
    - Used to add extra responsivity and styling to the layout of the cover Image text overlay. 
    I originally planned to include more W3.css animations on the gallery area, but decided to hold back 
    for a later release so the site can visibly grow more over several releases.
7. [EZ Gif](https://ezgif.com/)  
    - Used to edit the width/height of images used and decrease their file sizes
   whilst maintining the maximum quality possible. 
8. [Minify Code](http://minifycode.com/)   
   - Used to Minify the CSS file to improve rendering performance by the

    the document.

Testing

### **Validation** 
The W3C Markup Validator and The W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project
